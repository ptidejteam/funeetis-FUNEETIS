1. Use Case:Fitbit Sends Data and Buddy Moves
1.1 Precondition
EnableWheels is 0
Mood is 1
1.2 Basic Flow
1.Fitbit SENDS heart data to SmartPhone with heartrate=80 bpm Over HTTP
2.SmartPhone RECEIVES the heartrate data From Fitbit
3.SmartPhone SENDS heart data with heartrate=80 bpm to CloudApp over WebSocket
4.CloudApp RECEIVES heartrate data FROM fitbit Over HTTP
5.CloudApp CHECKS THAT heartrate is between 60 and 100 bpm
6.CloudApp SENDS MOVE command to Buddy with distance=1 and speed=1 Over WebSocket
7.Buddy RECEIVES MOVE command from CloudApp
8.Buddy SETS EnableWheels with leftWheel=1 and rightWheel=1
9.Buddy MOVES at specified distance and speed.
10.Buddy SENDS MOVE status to CloudApp with execution_status=WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED Over WebSocket
11.CloudApp RECEIVES MOVE execution status from Buddy Over WebSocket
Postcondition
Execution_status is WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED
1.3 Bounded Alternative Flow
RFS 1-11
1.IF CloudApp RECEIVES no heartrate data FROM SmartPhone THEN
2.CloudApp SENDS ROTATE command To Buddy with angle=50 and speed=30 Over WebSocket
3.Buddy SETS EnableWheels with leftWheel=1 and rightWheel=1 
4.Buddy ROTATES at specified angle and speed.
5.Buddy SENDS ROTATE status to CloudApp with execution_status=WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED Over WebSocket
6.CloudApp RECEIVES ROTATE execution status from Buddy Over WebSocket
7.ENDIF
Postcondition
Execution_status is WHEEL_MOVE_FINISHED 
1.4 Specific Alternative Flow
RFS 8
1.IF EnableWheels is not set to TRUE THEN
2.Buddy SETS execution_status to NOK
3.Buddy SENDS EnableWheel status to cloudApp with execution_status=NOK Over WebSocket
4.cloudApp RECEIVES execution status from Buddy Over WebSocket
5.ENDIF
Postcondition
Execution_status is NOK
Dog is Black
1.5 Specific Alternative Flow
RFS 5
1.IF EnableWheels is not set to TRUE THEN
2.Buddy SETS execution_status to NOK
3.Buddy SENDS EnableWheel status to cloudApp with execution_status=NOK over WebSocket
4.CloudApp RECEIVES execution status from Buddy Over WebSocket
5.ENDIF
Postcondition
Execution_status is NOK
EnableWheel is NOK
